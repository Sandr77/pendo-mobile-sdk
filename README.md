The Pendo Mobile SDK is a codeless, retroactive analytics collector across all of your app versions. The SDK allows presentation of in-app messages, tooltips and multi-step walkthrough guides built using Pendo's Visual Design Studio.

* The integration requires only a few lines of code.

* The SDK starts collecting analytics once the SDK is integrated.

* Analytics and guides will work across all your app versions.
